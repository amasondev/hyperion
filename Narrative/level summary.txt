==============================================


1ST LEVEL: Intro
(can teach mechanics in here?)

#0: 2 exits (to puzzle and combat route), both with switches to them
	- combat route's exit has a pic of the Mini Boss to indicate the upcoming enemy

---------------------------------------------------------------------
[Puzzle Route]

#1: 3x3 switchboard on the floor [*]
	- step on 1 block = switches colour (switch to either black or white)
	- solution to puzzle on the wall
	[*] deactivates Spawn Point 1 in the Combat Route

#2: 3 visible doors; 3 switches (but the switches do not correspond to the door)
	- Switch A: opens latch from above to expose enemies
	- Switch B: opens door at the opposite end (north) to expose enemies
	- Switch C: opens door at the opposite end (east) to expose Key Y + pots
	- "Z" Door (south): opens up to next room, but locked with passcode
		- passcode obtainable by defeating Mini Boss (picture shown as hint)
		- 3 tries only

#3: troll room; a vault (or something) in the center that says "do not break" 
	- if broken, will expose enemies
	- players can just go through door to next room

#4: colour room; must dye the colour prism with the dyes to the correct colour to pass
	- hint to what is the correct colour given on the wall
	- dyes can be used infinitely
	- if colour prism is dyed incorrectly, then a door opens up with enemies unleashed

#5: red carpet room; "carpet" changes colour
	- can only walk on carpet if green (or some other safe colour)
	- if players are on the carpet while it's not green, enemies unleashed from the side
	- side door locked with Key Y (obtained from #2), unlocks room with Key A + weapons

---------------------------------------------------------------------
[Combat Route]

Horde 1: Once open switch to the door for Combat Route, enemies unleashed
Flamethrower (or other weapon) available at the side after horde 1

Horde 2: Spawn Point 1 is visible further down from this horde

Horde 3: Spawn Point 2 is visible further down from this horde
Mini Boss is located here; drops solution passcode for "Z" Door

Horde 4: Located past Mini Boss and before Spawn Point 3

Line of HP: pots in a row for players
- hidden switch located in front of the HP line
	- if activated, drops Key X and unleashes enemies from above

Key X: opens up side door, reveals Key B + weapons

==============================================


2ND LEVEL: "Captain"

1. Meeting Room: 2 doors, both requires Key A + Key B
	- Text starts to appear here, from a "Captain" (refer to "2nd level voice text.txt")
	- Captain is actually an alien (or something like that) who claims to be able to help
	- players can either choose to listen to Captain's advice or not
	- if players use Key A+B on one of the doors, can still open the other door without the keys
		- a player unlocks the other door by "click and hold", while enemies start coming

---------------------------------------------------------------------
PATH A: follow Captain's advice

2A. 3 Vaults, 1 Key: key to open door is in 1 of 3 vaults (2 are enemies)
	- Text will tell players the above to break vaults for key
	- HP available in room also
	(possibly have a weapon in one of the vaults)

3A. Dummy Room: shows clues that something is fishy
	- broken door, warning signs, etc.
	(since door is broken, can just directly pass through)

4A. Final Room 1 - Boss Fight: revealed that the Captain is evil
	- must defeat the boss; enemy rush (small flow) also starts
	- door leading back is sealed shut (can't go back)
	- HP lined all around room
	- 2 secret walls with weapons (must shoot the walls down)

Ending 1: Victory - defeat boss
	- Boss dies, players escape successfully
	- screen fades to black

Ending 2: Defeat - all players died before boss is killled
	- Boss "eats" the players
	- screen fades to black

---------------------------------------------------------------------
PATH B: disregard Captain

2A. Deactivate Enemy Door (like a Spawn Point)
	- switch to deactivate door at side; must "click and hold" for x-seconds
	(possibly drop weapon when deactivated successfully)
	- door to next room is not locked

3A. Dummy Room: 2 doors (one of them red, leads to "4A. Final Room 1 - Boss Fight")
	- Captain gives final warning to player to go through red door
	- HP lined at the side
	(to correspond with Path A, since it also has a Dummy Room)
	- other door leads to Control Room (not locked, can pass through)

4A. Control Room: players must repair the control room to regain access to terminal
	- repair = click and hold again (?)
	- Captain threatens players, unleashes huge & endless enemy rush
	- door leading back is sealed shut (can't go back)
	- HP and weapons drop from ceiling (?)
	- once finished repairing, prompt to shut down terminal [Y]
		- if [N], can go back to terminal to get the prompt again and choose [Y]

Ending 3: Victory - terminal fixed + shut down successfully
	- screen immediately blacks out
	- Captain gives one last threat

Ending 4: Defeat - all players died before terminal gets fixed + shut down
	- Captain scorns the players' efforts
	- screen fades to black
